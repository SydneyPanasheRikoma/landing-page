# Figma Design Access Notes

## Access Status

✅ **Successfully Accessed**: The published Figma site at `https://raid-ebony-34758694.figma.site` is accessible through the browser MCP tool.

## What Was Accessible

1. **Live Published Site**: I was able to navigate to and view the interactive Figma prototype site
2. **Visual Elements**: Screenshots and visual descriptions of all sections
3. **Interactive Elements**: Navigation structure, buttons, forms, and links
4. **Hover States**: Observed hover effects on buttons and interactive elements

## Limitations

⚠️ **Not Accessible**: Direct access to the Figma design file (`.fig` file) or Figma editor
- Cannot access exact design specifications (spacing values, exact colors from design tokens)
- Cannot view layer structure or component details
- Cannot export assets directly from Figma
- Cannot see design system tokens or variables

## Effects Implemented Based on Visual Analysis

Based on the visual inspection of the published site, I've implemented:

1. **Animated Background Glows**
   - Pulsing radial gradients from top-left and top-right corners
   - Teal and green glow effects with smooth animations

2. **Text Gradient Effects**
   - "Sydney Rikoma" name with teal-to-green gradient
   - Subtle glow/shadow effects on gradient text

3. **Button Hover Effects**
   - "Get in Touch" button: Ripple effect, shadow enhancement, slight lift
   - "View Work" button: Text color change, border glow, smooth transitions

4. **Interactive Element Effects**
   - Logo hover: Glow and scale effect
   - Navigation links: Underline animation on hover
   - Cards: Lift effect with enhanced shadows and border glow
   - Form inputs: Focus glow and slight lift
   - Social links: Hover glow and background change

5. **Scroll Animations**
   - Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
   - Staggered animations for cards and items
   - Smooth scroll behavior

## Recommendations

If you need exact specifications:
1. Export design specs from Figma (Design → Inspect)
2. Share specific spacing, color values, or animation timings
3. Export assets (images, icons) directly from Figma
4. Share the Figma file link if you want me to reference specific design tokens
